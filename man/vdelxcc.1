.SH NAME
.PP
vdelxcc(1) \[en] vde for containers: client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]] [\f[I]VNL\f[R]]
.PP
\f[V]vdelxcc_static\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]] \f[I]socket\f[R]
[\f[I]VNL\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create a network interface connected to a VDE network.
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] forwards the request to the \f[V]vdelxcd\f[R] daemon
using a UNIX socket that must be shared with the hosting environment
(e.g.\ in a directory mounted at the container startup).
.PP
The default name of the communication socket is \f[V]vdelxcs\f[R] and
the default search path is \f[V]/vde:/var/vde\f[R]
(i.e.\ \f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] looks for the socket as \f[V]/vde/vdelxcs\f[R]
and \f[V]/var/vde/vdelxcs\f[R]).
The socket name or socket path can be redefined using a specific option
(see below).
The search path can be modified using the environment variable
\f[V]VDELXC_PATH\f[R].
.PP
The new interface is connected to the network defined by the Virtual
Network Locator \f[I]VNL\f[R] (see \f[V]vde_plug(1)\f[R] for the
definitiion of VNL).
\f[I]VNL\f[R] can be omitted if the daemon \f[V]vdelxcd\f[R] defines a
default network.
.PP
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] does not need any specific library.
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] is a dynamically linked executable requiring only the
C library (libc).
\f[V]vdelxcc_static\f[R] is a statically linked executable.
It is suitable for minimal containers having incompatible C libraries or
not supporting dynamic linking.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[V]-s\f[R] \f[I]socket\f[R], \f[V]--socket\f[R] \f[I]socket\f[R]
use this UNIX socket to communcate with the vdelxc daemon.
If \f[I]socket\f[R] is a name (does not contain slashes \f[V]/\f[R])
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] looks for the socket using the search path.
Id \f[I]socket\f[R] is not a name (contains slashes) \f[I]socket\f[R] is
used as the pathname of the socket.
Files of the current directory can be referred as `./name'.
.TP
\f[V]-i\f[R] \f[I]iface\f[R], \f[V]--iface\f[R] \f[I]iface\f[R]
set the name or the prefix for the interface value.
If the last char of \f[I]iface\f[R] is a digit, (e.g.\ \f[V]vde3\f[R])
it is used as the interface name otherwise \f[I]iface\f[R] is the prefix
of interface name.
For example using the option \f[V]-i eth\f[R] the interface is named
\f[V]eth\f[R]\f[I]nnn\f[R], i.e.\ \f[V]eth0\f[R] or \f[V]eth1\f[R]\&...
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] searches the first available name counting
\f[I]nnn\f[R] from 0.
The default value of \f[I]iface\f[R] is \f[V]vde\f[R], so the interfaces
are named \f[V]vde0\f[R], \f[V]vde1\f[R], etc.
.SH NOTES
.PP
\f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] creates an interface using the tuntap support and
transfers the file descriptor to the \f[V]vdelxcd\f[R] daemon through
the unix socket.
The process of \f[V]vdelxcc\f[R] terminates, the virtual network
interface is kept alive by the \f[V]vdelxcd\f[R] server.
.PP
If necessary virtual interfaces can be terminated from inside the
container, e.g.: \f[V]ip link delete vde0\f[R]
